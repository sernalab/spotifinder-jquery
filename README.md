# Spotifinder 🎧 #

## Description ##

Project created with jQuery and Spotify API.

[Here](https://github.com/juanmaguitar/exercises-javascript/tree/master/04-jquery-spotify-API) you can see the description of the exercise. 
As you can see we used those API links to complete the project:

```
    https://api.spotify.com/v1/search?type=artist&query=<ARTIST-NAME>
    https://api.spotify.com/v1/artists/<ID-ARTIST>/albums
    https://api.spotify.com/v1/albums/<ID-ALBUM>/tracks
```

 You can see my project [here](https://sernalab.github.io/spotifinder-jquery/).
